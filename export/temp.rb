A central landmark of the city, it is located on the Right Bank of the Seine in the city's 1st arrondissement (district or ward). Approximately 38,000 objects from prehistory to the 21st century are exhibited over an area of 72,735 square meters (782,910 square feet). In 2019, the Louvre received 9.6 million visitors, making it the most visited art museum in the world.\nThe museum is housed in the Louvre Palace, originally built as the Louvre castle in the late 12th to 13th century under Philip II. Remnants of the fortress are visible in the basement of the museum. Due to urban expansion, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function, and in 1546 Francis I converted it into the primary residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at the Louvre for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.\nThe museum opened on 10 August 1793 with an exhibition of 537 paintings, the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property. Because of structural problems with the building, the museum was closed in 1796 until 1801. The collection was increased under Napoleon and the museum was renamed Musée Napoléon, but after Napoleon's abdication, many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners. The collection was further increased during the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, and during the Second French Empire the museum gained 20,000 pieces. Holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the Third Republic. The collection is divided among eight curatorial departments: Egyptian Antiquities; Near Eastern Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculpture; Decorative Arts; Paintings; Prints and Drawings.", "properties"=>[{"key"=>"phone", "name"=>"Phone", "value"=>"+33 1 40 20 53 17", "ordinal"=>2}, {"key"=>"address", "name"=>"Address", "value"=>"Place du Carrousel", "ordinal"=>3}, {"key"=>"directions", "name"=>"Directions", "value"=>"Métro: Louvre", "ordinal"=>4}, {"key"=>"website", "name"=>"Website", "value"=>"http://www.louvre.fr", "ordinal"=>5}, {"key"=>"hours", "name"=>"Hours", "value"=>"Mo,Th,Sa,Su 09:00-18:00; We,Fr 09:00-21:45; Tu off; Jan 01,May 01,Dec 25 off", "ordinal"=>6}, {"key"=>"bus", "name"=>"Bus", "value"=>"27, 68, 95 (Musée du Louvre); 69, 72, N11 (Quai François Mittérand); 21, 67 (Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre);  (Palais Royal - Comédie Française); 74, 85 (Louvre — Rivoli); N12 (Pont des Arts - Quai de Conti)", "ordinal"=>7}, {"key"=>"subway", "name"=>"Subway", "value"=>"1, 7 (Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre)", "ordinal"=>8}, {"key"=>"train", "name"=>"Train", "value"=>"Palais Royal - Musée du Louvre", "ordinal"=>9}], "snippet"=>"Its exhibits come from such diverse origins as ancient Egypt, classical Greece and Rome, medieval Europe, and Napoleonic France.", "location_id"=>"Paris", "sightseeing_score"=>9.98996106246415}, {"id"=>"W__5013364", "name"=>"Eiffel Tower", "coordinates"=>{"latitude"=>48.8585238, "longitude"=>2.2939989}, "score"=>9.97596443243827, "intro"=>"The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ ; French: tour Eiffel ) is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.

The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.\nThe tower is 324m tall, about the same height as an 81- building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125m on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 17ft. Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276m above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels.

The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west), 17th (north) and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.\nAs the central cohesive element of the Axe historique (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the Louvre to the Grande Arche de la Défense), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by Jean Chalgrin in 1806; its iconographic programme pits heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages. Inspired by the Arch of Titus in Rome, Italy, the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of 50m, width of 45m and depth of 22m, while its large vault is 29.19m high and 14.62m wide. The smaller transverse vaults are 18.68m high and 8.44m wide. Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), Charles Godefroy flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch's primary vault, with the event captured on newsreel.\nParis's Arc de Triomphe was the tallest triumphal arch until the completion of the Monumento a la Revolución in Mexico City in 1938, which is 67m high. The Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang, completed in 1982, is modelled on the Arc de Triomphe and is slightly taller at 60m. La Grande Arche in La Defense near Paris is 110 metres high.

The cathedral was consecrated to the Virgin Mary and considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, as well as the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style. Major components that make Notre Dame stand out include one of the world's largest organs and its immense church bells.\nThe cathedral's construction began in 1160 under Bishop Maurice de Sully and was largely complete by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the following centuries. In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration during the French Revolution; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. In the 19th century, the cathedral was the site of the coronation of Napoleon I and the funerals of many Presidents of the French Republic.\nPopular interest in the cathedral blossomed soon after the publication, in 1831, of Victor Hugo's novel Notre-Dame de Paris (better known in English as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame). This led to a major restoration project between 1844 and 1864, supervised by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. The Allied liberation of Paris in 1944 was celebrated within Notre-Dame with the singing of the Magnificat. Beginning in 1963, the cathedral's façade was cleaned of centuries of soot and grime. Another cleaning and restoration project was carried out between 1991 and 2000.\nThe cathedral is one of the most widely recognized symbols of the city of Paris and the French nation. As the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the cathedra of the Archbishop of Paris (Michel Aupetit). In 1805, Notre-Dame was given the honorary status of a minor basilica. Approximately 12 million people visit Notre-Dame annually, making it the most visited monument in Paris. The cathedral was renowned for its Lent sermons, founded by the Dominican Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire in the 1830s. In recent years, an increasing number have been given by leading public figures and state-employed academics.\nThe cathedral has been progressively stripped of its original decoration and works of art. Several noteworthy examples of Gothic, Baroque, and 19th-century sculptures and a group of 17th- and early 18th-century altarpieces remain in the cathedral's collection. Some of the most important relics in Christendom, including the Crown of Thorns, a sliver of the true cross and a nail from the true cross, are preserved at Notre-Dame.\nWhile undergoing renovation and restoration, the roof of Notre-Dame caught fire on the evening of 15 April 2019. Burning for around 15 hours, the cathedral sustained serious damage, including the destruction of the flèche (the timber spirelet over the crossing) and most of the lead-covered wooden roof above the stone vaulted ceiling. Contamination of the site and the nearby environment resulted. Following the fire, many proposals were made for modernizing the cathedral's design. However, on 16 July 2019, the French Parliament passed a law requiring that it be rebuilt exactly as it appeared before the fire. Stabilising the structure against possible collapse is expected to continue until the end of 2020, with reconstruction beginning in 2021. The government of France hopes the reconstruction can be completed by Spring 2024, in time for the opening of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.", "properties"=>[{"key"=>"phone", "name"=>"Phone", "value"=>"+33 1 42 34 56 10", "ordinal"=>2}, {"key"=>"address", "name"=>"Address", "value"=>"Ile de la Cité 6, Place du Parvis Notre Dame", "ordinal"=>3}, {"key"=>"directions", "name"=>"Directions", "value"=>"Metro: St Michel", "ordinal"=>4}, {"key"=>"website", "name"=>"Website", "value"=>"http://www.notredamedeparis.fr", "ordinal"=>5}, {"key"=>"hours", "name"=>"Hours", "value"=>"07:45-18:45", "ordinal"=>6}, {"key"=>"bus", "name"=>"Bus", "value"=>"47 (Cité - Parvis Notre-Dame); 67, 69, 72, 76, 96 (Hôtel de Ville); 21, 38, N12, N13, N14 (Cité - Palais de Justice); 27 (Pont Saint-Michel - Quai des Orfèvres); 63 (Dante); N11 (Châtelet - Quai de Gesvres); ", "ordinal"=>7}, {"key"=>"subway", "name"=>"Subway", "value"=>"4 (Cité); 10 (Maubert - Mutualité); 7 (Châtelet)", "ordinal"=>8}, {"key"=>"train", "name"=>"Train", "value"=>"Cité; Saint-Michel Notre-Dame (voie 2); Saint-Michel Notre-Dame", "ordinal"=>9}], "snippet"=>"The early Gothic Cathédrale de Notre Dame has a 12th century design but wasn't completed until the 14th.", "location_id"=>"Paris", "sightseeing_score"=>9.94452825735194}, {"id"=>"Jardin_du_Luxembourg", "name"=>"Jardin du Luxembourg", "coordinates"=>{"latitude"=>48.84662674047892, "longitude"=>2.3358738985034275}, "score"=>9.9321532020504, "intro"=>"The Jardin du Luxembourg , also known in English as the Luxembourg Gardens, is located in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, France.

For this reason, its architect chose to clad the metal structure with fine masonry.\n\nThe new station was very modern in its time, introducing lifts for luggage, elevators for passengers, underground rail tracks and a hotel. Problems started in 1939 when trains became too long to fit the platforms and the station began to serve only suburban passengers. By 1973, the hotel was receiving fewer guests and closed.\n \nFor some time, there were discussions about demolishing the station and constructing a new hotel, but the building seemed an ideal site for a museum and was protected as a national monument in 1978.

The theatre has been a monument historique of France since 1923.\nThe Palais Garnier has been called \"probably the most famous opera house in the world, a symbol of Paris like Notre Dame Cathedral, the Louvre, or the Sacré Coeur Basilica.\" This is at least partly due to its use as the setting for Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera and, especially, the novel's subsequent adaptations in films and the popular 1986 musical.

It is located in the area known as the Latin Quarter, standing atop the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève, at the center of the Place du Panthéon which was named after it. The edifice was built from 1758 to 1790 over the designs of Jacques-Germain Soufflot at the behest of King Louis XV of France, who meant it as a church dedicated to Saint Genevieve, the city's patron saint, whose relics were to be housed there. Neither Soufflot nor Louis XV however lived to see the church completed.\nBy the time the construction was finished, the French Revolution had started, and the National Constituent Assembly voted in 1791 to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum for the remains of distinguished French citizens, modelled on the Pantheon in Rome which had been used in this way since the 16th century. The first panthéonisé was Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, although his remains were removed from the place a few years later. The building was twice restored to church usage in the course of the 19th century—although Soufflot's remains were transferred inside it in 1829—until the French Third Republic finally decreed its exclusive use as a mausoleum in 1881; the placement of Victor Hugo's remains in the crypt in 1885 was the first one in over fifty years.\nThe successive changes in the building's purpose resulted in modifications of the pediment's decoration, the capping of the dome by a cross or a flag, and some of the originally existing windows were blocked up with masonry in order to give the interior a darker and more funereal atmosphere, which compromised somewhat Soufflot's initial attempt at combining the lightness and brightness of the Gothic cathedral with classical principles. The architecture of the Panthéon is an early example of Neoclassicism, surmounted by a dome that owes some of its character to Bramante's Tempietto.\nAs of 2018 the remains of 78 people have been transferred to the Panthéon, including those of 73 men and 5 women.

The archeological remains still lie beneath the cathedral; the people buried there seem to have had a faith that was a mix of Christian and pre-Christian beliefs and practices. Around 475 St. Genevieve purchased some land and built Saint-Denys de la Chapelle. In 636 on the orders of Dagobert I the relics of Saint Denis, a patron saint of France, were reinterred in the basilica. The relics of St-Denis, which had been transferred to the parish church of the town in 1795, were brought back again to the abbey in 1819.\nThe basilica became a place of pilgrimage and the burial place of the French Kings with nearly every king from the 10th to the 18th centuries being buried there, as well as many from previous centuries. (It was not used for the coronations of kings, that function being reserved for the Cathedral of Reims; however, French Queens were commonly crowned there.) \"Saint-Denis\" soon became the abbey church of a growing monastic complex.\nIn the 12th century, the Abbot Suger rebuilt portions of the abbey church using innovative structural and decorative features. In doing so, he is said to have created the first truly Gothic building. The basilica's 13th-century nave is the prototype for the Rayonnant Gothic style, and provided an architectural model for many medieval cathedrals and abbeys of northern France, Germany, England and a great many other countries.\nThe abbey church became a cathedral in 1966 and is the seat of the Bishop of Saint-Denis, Pascal Michel Ghislain Delannoy. Although known as the \"Basilica of St Denis\", the cathedral has not been granted the title of Minor Basilica by the Vatican.\nThe 86m high spire, dismantled in the nineteenth century, will be rebuilt.

Only a few streets away from Montmartre's Basilica of the Sacré Cœur and the Lapin Agile, it is near the summit of the city's elevated Montmartre quarter.

Montmartre Abbey thrived through the centuries and until the French revolution under the patronage of the Kings of France. Place du Tertre was opened to the public in 1635 as Montmartre village central square. From the end of the 18th century until World War One, the whole Montmartre Boheme could been seen here: painters, songwriters and poets.\nWith its many artists setting up their easels each day for the tourists, the Place du Tertre is a reminder of the time when Montmartre was the mecca of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, many painters including Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, and Maurice Utrillo were living there, some at the nearby Le Bateau-Lavoir.
